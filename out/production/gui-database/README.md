A project that is aiming to create a GUI application for a database system to be used in a healthcare environment but can realistically be used anywhere with modifications.


Inspired by working at a hopsital working with spreadsheets over the summer, I thought to myself while retrieveing files and updating information about if the employee was still in this department or their certifications were expired or about to expire and updating things as necessary as well as making a list to inform department heads.

I thought to myself that there has to be a better way to do this, so I am gonna attempt to do so with this project.

Creating databases so that any employee can update their information whenever they need to and if time allows find a way to send automated emails or alerts from the application to wanr the user if certifications are expiring within 60 days or a month.
